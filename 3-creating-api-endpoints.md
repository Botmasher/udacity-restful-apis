# Creating your own API Endpoints

## Lesson 3 Intro
- we'll use Flask to build endpoints + backend + db
- check out the Flask documentation if you are unfamiliar
- (used in the Udacity FSF course, so try that if you want more exposure)

## 2. API Endpoints with Flask
- if you know Flask you know about the `@app.route` decorator
- that decorator helps render web pages or set up endpoints
- should also import `jsonify` to convert dicts into JSON objects
	- returns the Flask response object
	- that object already has the right headers
	- can be used with JSON responses
- next quiz: make basic API endpoints with Flask
